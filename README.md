# 🌲 Forest Fire Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📖 Overview
This project predicts the **Fire Weather Index (FWI)** using regression models trained on the Algerian Forest Fire dataset.  
It demonstrates an **end‑to‑end ML workflow**: data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment with Flask.

---

## ✨ Features
- Cleaned and preprocessed Algerian forest fire dataset (`Algerian_forest_fires_cleaned_dataset.csv`)  
- Feature engineering and correlation analysis  
- Regression models: **Linear, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet**  
- Ridge Regression selected as the final model (**R² = 0.98**)  
- Flask web app (`application.py`) for user input and predictions  
- HTML frontend (`templates/home.html`) for interactive use  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Python**: pandas, numpy, scikit‑learn, matplotlib, seaborn  
- **Flask**: backend deployment  
- **HTML/CSS**: frontend interface
